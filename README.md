### Jambo friend! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Ruth Nduta Muriithi, a Data Scientist. I have developed a solid foundation of technical and interpersonal skills that have enabled me to succeed in this field. I am confident in my ability to lead a team on a project; communicate the findings and recommendations of an analysis; or assist in the development of advanced machine learning algorithms. I thrive on tackling complex and difficult problems and employ advanced technical tools to educate, inform, and propel businesses.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time dancing under the stars pretending to be in Hollywood.
